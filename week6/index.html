          <h2>Projec Updatet: Return & Report</h2>
          <p class="casestudy">
            Started to wrap my head around the design so I could begin the
            database development. I initially started with a mobile size
            mock-up, but decided to switch to a desktop view for now. ONLY
            because as I've been researching different project management
            applications and how they flow, I'm intrigued by several different
            types, and wanted to have enough room to layout the forms. For this
            database project, I have initially put all of the INSERT statement
            forms onto one view page (per project/task set). However on a mobile
            device I think it would be best handled in a paginated progression.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy">
            This is where the task started taking on a life of it's own... I log
            the user in {SELECT} and then the program would authenticate the
            user. Then the start a new project view is delivered, and the user
            can then input the basic elements of their project {INSERT}. After
            that project item is built, the user could continue on to make
            additional Tasks and eventually subtasks, doo-dads, or tiny-tasks.
            Those would each rely on an {INSERT} statement as well.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy">
            When we see the project or workspace overview, we can see each line
            has a trach can or edit symbal. When the user clicks on either of
            those they will be able to delete {DELETE} or edit{SELECT, UPDATE}
            the item, respectively.

          <h3>Dev Issues:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Questioning "How FAR?"
              <li>Do I need sub-tasks</li>
              <li>Multiple views</li>
              <li>Filters for selecting all circles, some circles</li>

                <li>
                  Instead, lets add a button to "add to group calendar" or
                  something. So then it could go and be populated on a users
                  specific calendar.
