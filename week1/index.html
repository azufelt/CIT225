          <h2>Case Study:</h2>
          <p class="casestudy">
            You have joined a new company, and while you thought you were
            prepared, your manager believes you have a lot to learn. He has
            structured a twelve-week training program that should enable you to
            learn how to use the MySQL database to solve computer software
            engineering problems.
            <br /><br />
            Your manager has explained to you that your ability to work with and
            solve problems at the command line will directly correlate to your
            future contributions to the company. Your manager has also said that
            those limited to integrated development environments (IDEs), like
            MySQL Workbench, contribute less to the company.
            <br /><br />
            In your first week at the new company, your manager wants you to
            understand the differences between
            <span class="highlight"> non-relational </span> and
            <span class="highlight">relational databases</span> and how
            relational databases evolved from
            <span class="highlight">networked and hierarchical databases.</span>
            Your manager also wants you to
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Install a MySQL database on your desktop</li>
            <li>Create a database from the assigned Learning SQL textbook</li>
            <li>Populate the model</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="casestudy">
            You should return and report with a 3â€“5 paragraph report that
            clearly explains
            <span class="task"
              >why using the MySQL command line shell presents advantages that
              translate to productivity;</span
            >
            and the
            <span class="task"
              >difference between using an IDE and the CLI.</span
            >
            This paper should qualify what you learned by experimenting with the
            technology.

          With the importance of productivity on the rise, the need to decrease
          the cost of production has never been greater. Considering the
          environments available to developers, it's easy to see how using and
          mastering the Command Line Interface would quickly become the most
          productive way to handle development. <br /><br />Let's just talk
          strictly speed... While a using a graphical interface, the developer
          would have to move their mouse around to execute each tasks' function.
          The time this process takes can be greatly reduced by key stroke
          actions, or as we are referencing here, while using the Command Line
          Interface, inputing the commands. Speed is also sacrificied in the IDE
          as it requires additional resources to serve the graphical part,
          another point for utlizing the CLI!

          Another impactful, albeit simple, factor is the need of the developer
          to learn and become familiar with the graphical interface of the IDE,
          whereas the command line they can simply get started on the task.
        </p>
        <img class="comic" src="images/comic.png" />
        <p class="p4">
          Automation is another advantage that the CLI has over an IDE in the
          department of productivity. Often a simple CLI command can execute
          large group configurations simultaneously. Whereas with the GUI it
          would need to be scripted and then automated which eats away at
          productivity. <br /><br />Certainly there is a time and place for the
          use of and IDE, however if the developer can familiarize themselves
          with how the CLI works, how to manuever through to target and
          manipulate specific data sets, they will ultimately be far more
          productive.
