        <h2>Case Study:</h2>
        <p class="casestudy">
          You have had a profitable second week at your new company. You now
          know how to use Structured Query Language (SQL) mechanics to write
          queries.
          <br /><br />
          Your boss gave you a new task. This week, you should learn how to
          explain the various filtering techniques used in the WHERE clause.
          Your boss would like you to be able to compare and contrast the use
          of equality comparisons, inequality comparisons, range comparisons,
          and lookup operators like the IN operator.
          <br /><br />
          You should return and report with a 3â€“5 paragraph report that
          clearly explains

          <span class="task">what you learned about the various comparison operators in the
            WHERE clause.</span>
          This paper should qualify what you learned by experimenting with the
          technology.

        <h3>Explain Various WHERE clauses--</h3>
        <p>
          <pre>WHERE</pre> clause is a signifcant tool in querying to retrieve the correct data that is also delivered
          in farr more manageable amounts that returning such a large data-set.<br><br>
          Here is an example of if we wanted to find all the customers with the first name of "Ashley":
          <pre>
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'Ashley'</pre>
          In our movie rental database, on the customer table, these are the results that are returned:
          <img src="images/where_results.png" alt="database query results">
          That's a nice short list! </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <p>
          It's not always that short though, and so sometimes we may want to find something more specific and we can
          combine
          <pre>WHERE</pre> clauses to filter out even more data. Here we are using just a find
          <pre>WHERE</pre> the first name is equal to whichever name we have selected.
          We could also add in other filters by using the terms
          <pre>AND</pre> and
          <pre>OR</pre> When additional terms are used, then the filtered search must return a boolean match (True or
          False) for each of the terms it is given.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <h3>Comparison Operators--</h3>
        <p>Comparison Operators are the expression or operation that is used to make a comparison when filtering. It's
          similat to a child sorting blocks, and looking for the red one to go in the red slot, blue one to go in the
          blue slot, etc. When searching for data and making a filter request, we might be looking for:
          <ul>
            <li>Find all customers who spent more than $100</li>
            <li>Find sales from the weekend </li>
            <li>Find sales over $100</li>
          </ul>
          We could certainly get both those sets of data and try to manuall manipulate it, and do some
          cross-referencing... OR, we could use a combined filtering process that might be something more like:
          <ul>
            <li>Find all customer who spent more that $100 on a weekend</li>
            <li>
              <pre>
        SELECT customer_name
        FROM customer
        WHERE (price >= 100) AND (purchase_day = 'Saturday' OR purchase_day = 'Sunday')</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Using dates and numeric values utlize a range condition, where it doesn't evaluate to only True/False, within
          that match there is a range it could be TRUE by...  searching for something within a date range, for example, first quarter. Or searching within a specific number or alphabet range. </p>
          <p>Using filter parametes within a <pre>WHERE</pre>clause is essentially when deleting or updating data from a database. It helps target the correct piece of data so we aren't accidentally affecting the wrong item.</p>
        <p>
          As we can see from the following table there are many different operators that could be used to accurately specify a
          search query.
